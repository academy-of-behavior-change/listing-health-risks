# Listing health risks as predictor of health behavior

This is the GitHub repository for a project to test the hypothesis that people who engage in health behavior are able to list more behavior-specific health risks, for example that people who exercise regularly can name more diseases prevented by exercise than people who do not (if you correct for education level); that people who consistently use condoms can name more STI's than people who do not; or that people who don't drink alcohol can name more diseases causes by alcohol consumption than people who do not.

The Open Science Framework project page for this project is [https://osf.io/mncu9/](https://osf.io/mncu9/). This project is a part of the "Towards consensus on fear appeals" project that is hosted on the Open Science Framework at [https://osf.io/a2v46/](https://osf.io/a2v46/).
